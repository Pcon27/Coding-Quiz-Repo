// first step is to create variables: countownTimer, timeRemaining, button, correctAnswer, incorrectAnswer1, incorrectAnswer2, incorrectAnswer3, correctAnswer Total
// create memory of questions to be asked?
// create a start button in HTML and link it to a java function to start the beggining of the game 
// when the button is clicked, a timer stars, when the button is clicked, a set of questions is displayed
// if the correct answer is clicked, hide the previous text, and show the next round of questions and responses, track of the response through a web API 
// if the incorrect answer, subtract the timeRemaining by 10 seconds, then, hide the previous text, and show the next round of questions and responses.
// if there are no more questions OR if the timeRemanining is zero, hide the questions and thhe timer and prompt a message saying the game is over
//store the first score into a web API, then if the next score is greater than or equal too the previous score, prmompt a highscores page to pop up
// the three letter prompt should allow three letters, if the total string length is greater than four, than prompt a message saying please only type four letters
// save the score and thhe initials on the web API
